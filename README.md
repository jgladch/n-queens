#n-queens
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com).

Modelled after the class [Eight queens puzzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) this is an exercise in recursive algorithm design. The goal of the algorithm is to place N Queen chess pieces on an N by N sized chess board in such a way that no Queen attacks another queen.
